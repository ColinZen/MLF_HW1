# Group Member Contribution
Below is the detailed breakdown of each team member’s responsibilities and contributions to the assignment:

## Member 1: 郑强鑫 2025213633
- Completed the end-to-end **feature processing pipeline** in line with assignment requirements:
  1. Executed monthly cross-sectional data transformation: implemented the workflow of "ranking → percentiles calculation → mapping values to the [-1, 1] range" to standardize features.
  2. Performed monthly median imputation for missing feature values, ensuring data completeness for subsequent modeling.
  3. Created 2-digit SIC industry dummies, covering approximately 74 industry buckets to control for industry-specific variations.
- Independently built, trained, and fine-tuned three core models:
  1. **OLS-3 Model**: Constructed the baseline model using size, book-to-market (BM), and momentum factors; verified its performance against the test set.
  2. **Random Forest (RF) Model**: Designed a hyperparameter grid (tree depth: {3, 5, 7}; number of trees: {100, 300, 500}) and conducted rolling validation to select optimal parameters; evaluated model stability via out-of-sample \(R_{oos }^{2}\).
  3. **Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) Model**: Tuned critical hyperparameters (learning rate: {0.05, 0.1, 0.2}; tree depth: {3, 5, 7}; number of trees: {100, 300, 500}) through annual re-estimation and rolling validation; optimized model predictive accuracy based on validation set performance.
- Created and edited all model-related visualization materials, including (but not limited to) feature importance bar plots for RF/GBRT, 36-month rolling \(R_{oos }^{2}\) curves for stock-level evaluation, and residual distribution histograms.


## Member 2: 竺瑞航 2025213637
- Led the **data merging process**: Integrated multi-source datasets (e.g., CRSP stock monthly data, Compustat firm fundamentals, and CRSP-Compustat Merged (CCM) link table) while strictly adhering to lag rules (annual data ≥ 6 months lag, quarterly data > 4 months lag, monthly data ≥ 1 month lag) to prevent look-ahead bias.
- Built and fine-tuned the **Elastic Net (ENet) model**: Tested hyperparameters for α (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) and l1_ratio; selected the optimal model configuration via rolling validation using out-of-sample \(R_{oos }^{2}\) as the evaluation metric.
- Assisted in the hyperparameter tuning of the GBRT model: Collaborated with Member 1 to validate the impact of learning rate and tree depth adjustments on model performance, providing supplementary test results for parameter selection.
- Fulfilled all requirements under **Q7 (Diagnostics & Tuning Trial)**:
  1. Analyzed residual distributions of key models (OLS-3, ENet, RF) to assess the robustness of predictions against outliers.
  2. Conducted subgroup analysis by size buckets, evaluating model performance differences across small, medium, and large-cap stocks.
  3. Identified overfitting symptoms by comparing validation set and test set performance metrics (e.g., \(R_{oos }^{2}\), prediction error) for all models.
  4. Attempted an additional tuning experiment (e.g., adjusting ENet’s α from 0.5 to 0.7) and documented its impact on model performance—including detailed records even though the tuning did not yield significant improvements

## 🧭 Overview

This repository implements a **complete replication pipeline** of the asset pricing machine learning framework proposed by **Gu, Kelly, and Xiu (2020)**.

The goal is to replicate their **rolling-year predictive regressions** and **cross-sectional forecasting experiments**, comparing traditional linear models with non-linear machine learning methods:

| Model Type        | Methods Implemented                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear Models     | OLS, ElasticNet                                    |
| Tree-based Models | Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (GBRT / HistGBRT) |

All experiments follow the same **rolling validation** logic:

* Expanding training window (1957–Y−13)
* Validation window (Y−12 ~ Y−1)
* Test year (Y)
* Out-of-sample R² calculated via Gu–Kelly–Xiu Eq. (19)

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation

**Script path:**
`data_downloading&processing/`

**Files involved:**

* `crsp_monthly_1957_2021_sample.csv`
* `datashare_sample.csv`
* `macro_factors.parquet`
* `t_bill.csv`

**Main steps:**

1. Merge CRSP firm-level data with macro factors.
2. Generate lagged predictors (`c_`, `m_`, `sic_` prefixed).
3. Rank-normalize features cross-sectionally.
4. Save processed dataset to:

   ```
   data/processed/features.parquet
   ```

## 🔬 Evaluation Metric: Out-of-Sample R²

[
R^2_{OOS} = 1 - \frac{\sum_t (y_t - \hat{y}_t)^2}{\sum_t y_t^2}
]

* Evaluated annually and cumulatively.
* A positive (R^2_{OOS}) indicates predictive power beyond the mean model.
